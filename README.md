Sample projects to show how configure and run SonarCloud analysis from GitHub Actions runtime:

* Maven: see the [branch `maven`](https://github.com/simonbrandhof/sonarcloud-github-action-sample/tree/maven)
* Projects that do not need to be built (Python, JS, TS, PHP, Ruby and others) should use the [SonarCloud GitHub Action](https://github.com/sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action): see the [branch `standard`](https://github.com/simonbrandhof/sonarcloud-github-action-sample/tree/standard)
